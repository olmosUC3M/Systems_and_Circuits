# Systems and Circuits

Teaching material used for the course [Systems and Circuits](https://aplicaciones.uc3m.es/cpa/generaFicha?est=217&asig=13493&idioma=2) in first year undegraduate of Telecomunication Engineering at [University Carlos III in Madrid (Spain)](https://www.uc3m.es/Home). The objectives of the course are 1) to introduce the basic concepts of signals and systems with an emphasis on their use in communication, and 2) as particularization of the above, to introduce the basic concepts of electric circuit analysis. 

We provide the [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) source code for the slides used in the 12 lectures of the course:
1. Signals and basic operations
2. Periodicity, Energy and Power
3. Basic Signals: impulse, the unit step, and the complex exponential signal
4. Resistive Circuits and Kirchoff Laws
5. Techniques of Circuit Analysis
6. Techniques of Circuit Analysis (II): the Thévenin equivalnet
7. Introduction to Systems
8. LTI systems and the convolution operation
9. Properties of LTI Systems
10. Capacitance & Inductance
11. RC, RL and RLC circuits
12. Sinosuidal Steady-State Analysis
