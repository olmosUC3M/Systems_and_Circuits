pst-sigsys package  2011/07/03 v1.4
-----------------------------------
This package is a collection of useful macros for disciplines related to signal processing.
It defines macros for plotting a sequence of numbers, drawing the pole-zero diagram of a
system, shading the region of convergence, creating an adder or a multiplier node, placing
a framed node at a given coordinate, creating an up-sampler or a down-sampler node,
drawing the block diagram of a system, drawing adaptive systems, sequentially connecting
a list of nodes, and connecting a list of nodes to one node using any node-connecting
macro. The author welcomes all comments for further improvements of this package and
suggestions for adding new macros or features.
